<h3>Project Details:</h3>
<p>This project is a part of the Full Stack JavaScript path of The Odin Project's curriculum. </p>

<p>The objective of this project was to solidify OOP (Object Oriented Programming) principles, as well as to put all of the other skills we have learned so far to the test. I decided to spend a bit of extra time polishing the UI of this project, making it nice and responsive for all (hopefully) screen sizes.</p>

<h3>Created With:</h3>
